Welcome to the Groww Server repository! This Node.js application serves as the backend for the Groww Clone project. Below, you'll find instructions on how to set up the development environment and configure necessary variables using the `.env` file.


## Installation

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download and install them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ritik5Prasad/GrowwServer.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
   cd groww-server
 ```

3. Rename the `env_template` file to `.env`:

```sh
   mv env_template .env
  ```

## Configuration

Open the `.env` file in your favorite text editor and fill in the required details. If you're unsure about what to fill, you can refer to the following YouTube playlist for guidance: [Groww Clone YouTube Playlist](https://youtu.be/Y9jpFvzkofI?si=KxT_XP9-UrnWcVIS).


## Running the Server

Once you have configured the `.env` file, you can start the server by running:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

This will install the necessary dependencies and start the server on the specified port.
